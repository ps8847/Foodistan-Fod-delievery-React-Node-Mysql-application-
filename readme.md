# Steps to run This Project 

1. Open You Xampp server and make the database named >> food_delievery_db 
    after that import the "food_delievery_db.sql" file into your database.
2. After that Open the main project folder on your code editor (i'll prefer open it on VScODE)
3. when it'll open then Simply open the terminal and split your terminal into two parts 
4. in first terminal write the command >> cd client 
      After that write the command >> npm start
5 . in second terminal write the command >> cd server
      After that write the command >> npm start
      
That's it,,,, Now your application will be visible on the browser as
# localhost:3000    (client panel)
# localhost:3000/Admin_public/adminlogin  (restricted or Admin area)

You can get the required login credentials from the database and the appropriate table for which you want the login credentials
